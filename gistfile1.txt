These are custom lockout and block messages for wordfence.  If you have to ask why you want these, they probably aren't for you.

To use, simply copy them to `/wp-content/plugins/wordfence/lib` overwriting the existing versions (you can back them up first if you'd like.)

Unfortunately, you need to re-copy thse after each Wordfence update.
